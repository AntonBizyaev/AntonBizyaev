Hi everyone,

My name is Anton Bizyaev and I've been passionate about doing data analysis since 2019. I have working experience at Russian Central Bank, top-1 university of Russia, and Russian Academy of Science. Experienced with Python, SQL and Excel. I am used to solving broadly defined problems in changing environments, which require teamwork and non-standard approaches to solve. I love it most when data facilitates better decision making and I'm always open for a creative collaboration.
